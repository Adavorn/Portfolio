#  Battle Game

A 2D pixel-art survival game built with **HTML5 Canvas** and **JavaScript**. Dodge demonic enemies, collect power potions, and strike back before your health runs out. This project was created to demonstrate canvas-based game logic, collision detection, and user interface management in a lightweight, fun format.
