#  Jacob King's Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository â€” a collection of focused web applications built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. Each project demonstrates specific skills in frontend development, including API integration, DOM manipulation, form handling, and responsive UI design.

This repository includes a central **Project Hub**, a clean and responsive landing page that links to each hosted project. It was built without frameworks and provides a user-friendly overview of my work â€” ideal for code reviewers, employers, and collaborators.

##  Project Hub

 **Live Site:** [adavorn.github.io/Portfolio](https://adavorn.github.io/Portfolio/)

The Project Hub serves as the main entry point to all subprojects. It is styled with dark mode for comfort and built using plain HTML and CSS. The layout is mobile-friendly and easy to navigate.

##  Disclaimers & Notes

### API Key Security
The **YouTube API Search App** includes a hardcoded API key for demonstration purposes only. In a production environment, this key should:
- Be stored in a secure backend (e.g., Node.js, Express)
- Or routed through a secure proxy server  
 Never expose unrestricted API keys in frontend code intended for public use.

### API Rate Limits
The included key is subject to [YouTube's quota limits](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota). Use your own key if forking or deploying independently.

### Static Limitations
These applications are fully static and do not include:
- Server-side rendering
- Backend logic
- Persistent state or database functionality

They are intended for **learning, demonstration, and portfolio** purposes only.

##  Future Enhancements

- Add pagination and loading indicators to the YouTube app  
- Include video metadata such as duration and channel  
- Add additional subprojects with API integration  
- Migrate sensitive logic to backend proxies for security
