# YouTube API Search App

A sleek and responsive web application that allows users to search for YouTube videos using the [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3). This project is built with **HTML**, **CSS** (dark mode), and **vanilla JavaScript**, and deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

Designed as a portfolio piece to demonstrate API integration, UI responsiveness, and dynamic client-side logic â€” without the use of frameworks or bundlers.

##  Disclaimers & Usage Notes

### API Key Security
This project includes a hardcoded API key for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world production setting:

- The API key should be stored securely on a backend (e.g., Node.js/Express)
- Or routed through a proxy server to avoid public exposure
- **Never expose unrestricted keys in frontend code intended for production**

### API Quotas & Rate Limits
- This demo may exceed [YouTube API quota limits](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota) if used heavily
- It is recommended to use your own API key if testing locally or deploying your own fork

### Static App Limitations
- This application is a static frontend demo
- No server-side rendering, pagination, search history, or persistent storage is included
- Intended for **learning and portfolio** use â€” not for production or commercial deployment

---

##  Future Enhancements (Planned)

- Show video duration and channel name  
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling  
- Add loading states and error handling  
- Move API interaction to a backend for key protection
